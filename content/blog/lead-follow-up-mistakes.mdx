You're spending thousands on lead generation—Zillow, Facebook ads, Google PPC, and more. But if you're like most agents, you're making critical follow-up mistakes that are costing you deals.

Let's examine the five most common errors and how to fix them.

## Mistake #1: Waiting Too Long to Call

**The Problem:** The average agent takes 15+ hours to respond to a new lead. By that point, the lead has forgotten they even submitted an inquiry—or worse, they've already talked to three of your competitors.

**The Solution:** Respond within 5 minutes. Studies show this increases qualification rates by up to 21x compared to a 30-minute response time.

**Pro Tip:** If you can't guarantee sub-5-minute response, partner with a professional ISA service that can. This single change often pays for itself within the first month.

## Mistake #2: Giving Up Too Soon

**The Problem:** Most agents stop calling after 1-2 attempts. But research shows it takes an average of **8 touchpoints** to convert a lead.

**The Follow-Up Cadence That Works:**
- Day 1: Call + text + email
- Day 2: Call + text
- Day 3: Call
- Day 5: Call + email
- Day 7: Call + text
- Day 14: Call + email
- Day 21: Call
- Day 30: Email with market update

**The Solution:** Implement a systematic follow-up sequence and stick to it. Use your CRM to automate reminders so no lead falls through the cracks.

## Mistake #3: Not Qualifying Before the Appointment

**The Problem:** You're spending precious hours with "buyers" who are 18 months from purchasing or "sellers" who will never actually list.

**The BANT Qualification Framework:**
- **B**udget - Are they pre-approved? What's their price range?
- **A**uthority - Are all decision-makers involved?
- **N**eed - What's driving their move?
- **T**imeline - When do they need to buy/sell?

**The Solution:** Qualify thoroughly before booking appointments. Your time with fully qualified prospects will be more productive, and you'll close more deals with less effort.

## Mistake #4: Using the Same Script for Every Lead Source

**The Problem:** A Zillow lead looking at a specific property requires a completely different conversation than a Facebook ad lead responding to a market report offer.

**Lead Source Differences:**

| Source | Intent Level | Best Approach |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Zillow | High | Property-specific, immediate |
| Facebook | Medium | Value-add, educational |
| Google PPC | Medium-High | Answer their search query |
| Open House | High | Relationship-focused |
| Expired/FSBO | Varies | Empathetic, consultative |

**The Solution:** Develop source-specific scripts that acknowledge how the lead found you and what they're likely looking for.

## Mistake #5: Not Tracking the Right Metrics

**The Problem:** You're measuring activity (calls made) instead of outcomes (appointments booked, deals closed).

**Metrics That Actually Matter:**
- **Contact rate** - % of leads you actually reach
- **Qualification rate** - % of contacts that are qualified
- **Appointment rate** - % of qualified leads that book appointments
- **Show rate** - % of appointments that actually show up
- **Conversion rate** - % of appointments that become clients

**The Solution:** Track the full funnel. When you know where leads are dropping off, you can fix the specific problem rather than just "making more calls."

## The Compound Effect of Fixing These Mistakes

Let's say you're currently converting 2% of your internet leads into closed deals. Here's what happens when you fix each mistake:

| Mistake Fixed | Improvement | New Rate |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Speed-to-lead | +50% | 3% |
| Follow-up persistence | +40% | 4.2% |
| Better qualification | +30% | 5.5% |
| Source-specific scripts | +20% | 6.6% |
| Proper metrics | +25% | 8.25% |

**That's a 4x improvement in conversion rate.** On 50 leads per month at $10,000 average commission, that's an extra $30,000/month.

## The Easiest Path Forward

Here's the truth: fixing all five of these mistakes requires significant time, training, and systems. Most agents don't have the bandwidth to do it themselves while also serving clients.

That's why more and more successful agents are outsourcing lead follow-up to professional ISA services. You focus on what you do best—working with clients and closing deals—while trained professionals handle the calling, qualifying, and appointment setting.

## About Coastal Realty Group

Coastal Realty Group is a 15-agent real estate team based in San Diego, California. Led by team leader Michael Johnson, they specialize in coastal properties ranging from $500K condos to $3M+ luxury homes.

The team generates leads through multiple channels including:
- Zillow Premier Agent
- Facebook and Instagram ads
- Google PPC campaigns
- Their IDX website
- Realtor.com

## The Challenge

When Michael approached ISA Connect, his team was drowning in leads but starving for appointments. Despite spending over $15,000/month on lead generation across various platforms, they were only booking 8 appointments per month.

The core problems were:

### 1. Slow Response Times
With agents showing homes and managing transactions, new leads often sat untouched for hours—sometimes days. Their average speed-to-lead was over 4 hours.

### 2. Inconsistent Follow-Up
Without a dedicated ISA, follow-up was sporadic. Agents would make 1-2 attempts then move on, leaving money on the table.

### 3. No Evening/Weekend Coverage
60% of their leads came in outside business hours, and those leads received no contact until Monday morning.

### 4. Agent Burnout
Agents were spending evenings calling cold leads instead of focusing on active clients and closings.

## The ISA Connect Solution

We implemented a comprehensive lead response system tailored to Coastal Realty Group's needs:

### Speed-to-Lead Protocol
- **Immediate response**: All new leads contacted within 5 minutes, 24/7
- **Multi-channel outreach**: Phone call, text, and email on first contact
- **Lead source-specific scripts**: Different approaches for Zillow vs. Facebook vs. website leads

### Structured Follow-Up Sequence
We created an 8-touch follow-up cadence over 30 days:

| Day | Contact Method |
|-----|----------------|
| 1 | Call + Text + Email |
| 2 | Call + Text |
| 3 | Call |
| 5 | Call + Email |
| 7 | Call + Text |
| 14 | Call + Email |
| 21 | Call |
| 30 | Email + Text |

### Qualification Standards
Before booking any appointment, our ISAs verified:
- Pre-approval status for buyers
- Motivation and timeline (within 6 months)
- Decision-maker involvement
- Budget alignment with inventory

### CRM Integration
We integrated directly with their Follow Up Boss instance, ensuring:
- All call notes logged automatically
- Appointments synced to agent calendars
- Lead status updates in real-time
- Full visibility into the pipeline
